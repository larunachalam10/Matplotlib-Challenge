# Matplotlib-The Power of Plots

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 


FOLLOWING TASKS OF DATA ANALYSIS
--------------------------------

1. Check for mouse ID for duplicate time points and remove any data associated with that mouse ID.
2. Use Clean data for data analysis.
3. Generate Summary statistics table consisting mean, median, variance, STD and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
4. Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows  the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.
5. Generate a pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
6. Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
7. Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
8. Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.
9. Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
10. Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.

OBSERVATIONS
-------------

With the generated figures and tables , write 3 observations or inferences that can be made from the data.
